# Reflection Document

## Project Overview
This project focused on building and enhancing a **User Management** system with various improvements, including a major feature: **Profile Picture Upload with Minio**.

Throughout this project, I have learned:
- How to integrate **object storage** solutions like **Minio** into FastAPI applications.
- How to set up **Docker** environments for local development and production.
- How to build robust **CI/CD pipelines** with **GitHub Actions** for testing, building, pushing Docker images, and scanning vulnerabilities.
- Best practices in **test-driven development** by adding and validating **QA issue fixes** and **new tests**.
- Troubleshooting Git issues like `.git` corruption and recovering repository history safely.
